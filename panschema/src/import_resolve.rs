//! Load-time resolution of LinkML `imports:` into one merged schema.
//!
//! A LinkML `SchemaDefinition` may list other schemas in `imports:`.
//! Those entries deserialize today but nothing follows them, so a
//! vocabulary split across files renders only the root file's elements.
//! This module closes that gap: before any writer runs, it loads each
//! imported local file via the [`FormatRegistry`], merges its elements
//! into the root, and hands every writer a schema shaped exactly like a
//! single-file one.
//!
//! Imports resolve transitively (imports of imports), and a file
//! reached via two paths — a diamond — is loaded and merged exactly
//! once, deduplicated by canonical path.
//!
//! The merge unions `classes`, `slots`, `enums`, `types`, and
//! `prefixes`. When two files define the same name, structurally equal
//! definitions are silently unified; differing ones are an incompatible
//! collision — the kept definition (root precedence) wins, the other is
//! dropped, and a [`Collision`] records both files. Each merged
//! element's origin file is recorded for provenance.
//!
//! A self-import or an import cycle is a hard error, never an infinite
//! loop: every file is canonicalized and tracked on the resolution
//! path, and re-entering a path on that path is rejected — across the
//! full transitive graph, not just direct self-imports.
//!
//! Out of scope here (handled elsewhere): CURIE / URL imports and
//! builtin `linkml:*` imports. An entry that doesn't resolve to a local
//! file is reported through [`ImportError`] rather than crashing.
