//! Diagnostics for LinkML constructs panschema parses but does not model.
//!
//! `serde` silently ignores unknown YAML keys, so a producer can write a
//! real constraint (`rules`, `unique_keys`, a boolean class expression)
//! and ship a schema where it is quietly dropped. [`ClassDefinition`]
//! captures such keys in its `unmodeled` catch-all; this module warns on
//! them.
//!
//! The guard warns by **default**: the ignore-list starts empty, so every
//! unmodeled key is reported until a specific one is identified as safe to
//! silence. That direction is deliberate — an allowlist could only catch
//! drops we already anticipated, leaving the exact blind spot the guard
//! exists to close.
//!
